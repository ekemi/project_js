Greeting
Hey there, thanks for checking out this customer order app. I created this application for my Flatiron School Project #4: JavaScript and Rails API Project.

Description
The idea for costomer order app  came from my own experience: Iâ€™m trying to start my own orline shopping side business, and one of the big parts of selling clothes  is being consistant. I wanted to create a site where users could buy good things at a goog price.

Installation
To use this app, clone this repository, change directories into photoloco/backend. Run rails db:create, rails db:migrate, rails db:seed, and then rails s. Then open frontend/index.html.

Contributing
Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub . This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct.
